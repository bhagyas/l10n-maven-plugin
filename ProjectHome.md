**This project has [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/rquinio/l10n-maven-plugin)!**




# News #

**30 Nov 2014**: l10n-maven-plugin-**1.8** is available, check the [ReleaseNotes](ReleaseNotes.md).

# Description #

The localization process of an application often involves non technical people. Some translated resources may contain issues linked to formatting, encoding, or the context where the resource is used.

l10-maven-plugin can validate a set of [properties files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) (mainly used in Java [ResourceBundle](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html)). It aims to either:
  * Detect invalid l10n properties resources at build time, typically before the webapp is packaged, or when extracting properties files from a localization tool/database (**[l10n:validate goal](Usage#l10n:validate.md)**).
  * Build a Maven site report listing violations found on properties (**[l10n:report goal](Usage#l10n:report.md)**), see a [sample report](http://wiki.l10n-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/git/SampleReport.html).

The plugin was initially developed for some webapps translated in 7 languages with several thousands of properties across 5 resource bundles. It allowed to prevent buggy translations from slipping into production and reduced the cost of fixing them by detecting issues earlier.

It aims to be a pragmatic solution when having legacy constraints or needing fast & easy tool, yet probably not the ideal solution in terms of usability:
  * Some checks could rather be performed as soon as translator uploads/inputs the translation in the localization tool, to provide instant feedback.
  * Encoding/escaping should rather be managed by the code using the resources, based on the context they are being used (server side, client side, ...) rather than in the resources themselves.

# Usage #

See [Usage](Usage.md) page for plugin goals and detailed configuration.

Plugin is available on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.googlecode.l10n-maven-plugin%22), through [Sonatype OSS hosting](https://oss.sonatype.org).

# Requirements #

The following specifies the _minimum_ requirements to run this Maven plugin:

| Library | Min version | Notes |
|:--------|:------------|:------|
| **Maven** | **2.2.1**   | Might work on previous Maven 2 versions, but not tested. |
| **JDK** | **1.5**     |       |


# Validation #

The files are loaded as Java [Properties](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html) and some checks are performed, depending on the type of resource.

| **Resource type** | **Detection** | **Notes** |
|:------------------|:--------------|:----------|
| Translated resource | Resource translated in more than 1 language |           |
| Parametric resource | Resource containing formatting parameters. Supports java.text.MessageFormat {0} {1,date} etc., as well as java.util.Formatter %1$s %2$s (explicitly indexed args only)|           |
| HTML resource     | Resource key matching _htmlKeys_ plugin property (default: _.text._) | [HTML5 data-\* custom attributes](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data) are ignored |
| Js resource       | Resource key matching _jsKeys_ plugin property (default: _.js._) | Also considered as an HTML/Text resource, after javascript unescaping |
| URL resource      | Resource key matching _urlKeys_ plugin property (default: _.url_.) | HTML unescaping is applied before validation |
| Plain text resource | Resource key matching _textKeys_ plugin property (default: _.title._) |           |
| Custom resource   | Resource key matching a custom pattern |           |
| Other resource    | Resource key not matching any of the previous |           |

Most checks apply at property value level, but some coherency checks have a larger scope (whole property file, whole multi-language bundle)

| **Resource type** | **Check** | **Severity** | **Description** | **Impact** | **Example** |
|:------------------|:----------|:-------------|:----------------|:-----------|:------------|
| All               | Duplicate keys | Error        | Same key is used twice in same property file | Unspecified behaviour on which value will get loaded | -           |
| Translated        | Missing translations | Warn         | Resource is translated in at least 2 languages excluding root bundle (meaning translation process has somehow started), but not all languages | Default language/nothing/???key??? is displayed depending on implementation | -           |
| Translated        | Identical translations | Info         | Resource has identical translations in all languages, it could be moved to root bundle | Duplication, risk of de-synchronization between languages | -           |
| Translated        | Almost identical translations | Warn         | Resource has identical translations in most languages, but a different one in few (less than half) languages, suggesting it may not be language dependent and a typo error. |            | -           |
| Translated        | Trailing [whitespace](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#isWhitespace%28char%29) | Warn         | Resource has a trailing character, that could indicate some translation concatenation. | Syntax errors in some languages (spaces, order of words) | ```properties
example.text.start=Hello ``` ```properties
example.text.end= !```|
| Translated        | Spellcheck | Warn         | Resource has some spell-checking errors, using [Jazzy Spellchecker](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jazzy/). Dictionaries have to be provided to the plugin. Proper nouns (brands, ...) and other domain specific keywords or terms can be added to a dedicated user-defined dictionary (language dependant or not) to reduce false positives. | Syntax errors |             |
| Parametric        | Unescaped single quotes | Error        | Single quotes are not escaped by another single quote. Limitation: Single quotes used as escape sequence (ex: '{this text is escaped}') will raise false positive | Single quotes swallowed by MessageFormat, or formatting not applied | ```properties
example.param=this is {0}'s book``` |
| Parametric        | Incoherent parameters | Warn         | Usage of parameters between languages is incoherent (different number of parameters, or different index used), the order of the parameters being ignored. Limitation: Types are ignored here, {0, date} is considered the same as {0}  | Translation has no meaning | bundle\_en.properties: ```properties
example.param=Hello {0} !``` bundle\_fr.properties:```properties
example.param=Bonjour {1} !``` |
| Parametric        | Escaped single quotes | Warn         | Some single quotes are escaped but resource does not contain any formatting parameter. Limitation: if the parametric replacement is not performed by MessageFormat - for instance in javascript-, it is assumed it will follow same behaviour and consume escaped single quotes | Two single quotes displayed | ```properties
example.noparam=this is John''s book```|
| Parametric        | Unknown substituted resource | Error        | If properties are loaded via a library allowing resource substitution (such as [eProperties](https://eproperties.googlecode.com/svn/docs/1.1.1/manual/syntax.html#substitution), [XProperties](http://www2.sys-con.com/ITSG/virtualcd/Java/archives/0612/mair/index.html) or [Apache commons](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/userguide/howto_basicfeatures.html#Variable_Interpolation)), checks that the substituted resource actually exists |            | ```properties
example.included = Re-used text``` ```properties
example.text = ${example.inclued} ```|
| HTML              | XHTML validation | Error        | XHTML validation fails using [XHTM 1.0 transitional](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) (default), XHTML 1.0 strict or [XHTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-xhtml-syntax.html#the-xhtml-syntax) (using [XMLmind schema](http://www.xmlmind.com/xhtml5_resources.shtml)). Note: data-**attributes are ignored during validation**| Malformed HTML, dependent on browser quirks | ```properties
example.html=some <b>important<b> text``` HTML b tag is not correctly closed ```properties
example.html=bed &amp breakfast``` Missing ; after &amp HTML entity |
| HTML              | Incoherent tags | Warn         | HTML tag usage is not coherent between translations of a resource (order is ignored). Limitation: nested tags coherence is not checked | Incoherent translations | bundle\_en.properties: ```properties
example.text=This is <b>important

Unknown end tag for &lt;/b&gt;

``` bundle\_fr.properties:```properties
example.text=C'est <strong>important

Unknown end tag for &lt;/strong&gt;

```|
| Js                | Newline characters | Error        | Some newline characters (\n, \r) are present. They are interpreted as end of javascript statement by browsers | Javascript error | ```properties
example.js=Some client side text\n``` |
| Js                | Unescaped quotes | Error        | Quotes are unescaped  (" or ' depending on configuration). | Javascript error | ```properties
example.js=click on "Ok"``` ```jsp
var text="<fmt:message key='example.js'/>"; ``` |
| URL               | Pseudo-URL syntax | Error        | Not a valid (pseudo-)URL pattern. Limitaion: only https(s),ftp and mailto protocol allowed, if any | Invalid link (Unknown address) | ```properties
example.url=http//www.google.com``` |
| URL               | HTML imports | Error        | URL is an HTML import and does not support https context (cf [scheme relative URLs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3583103/network-path-reference-uri-scheme-relative-urls)). | Mixed content warning | ```properties
example.url=http://www.google.com/script.js``` |
| Plain text        | No HTML   | Error        | Contains HTML   | Tags not interpreted by browser | ```properties
example.alt=alternative text<br/>of an image``` |
| Plain text        | No URL    | Error        | Contains URL    | URLs not clickable | ```properties
example.alt=Go to http://www.google.com```|
| Custom            | Custom pattern | Error        | [custom pattern](CustomPatterns.md) regex doesn't match. |            |             |
| Other             | Wrong resource type | Warn         | Contains HTML or URL but wasn't checked, so probably some key patterns are wrong in plugin configuration |            | ```properties
example.other=This is <br/> actually HTML``` |
| Other             | Excluded  | Info         | Resource has been skipped using _excludedKeys_ configuration property. If this was to bypass a false positive raised by the plugin for a somehow valid case, feel free to [report a bug](http://code.google.com/p/l10n-maven-plugin/issues/list) ;-)  | No check performed |             |

There are 3 severity levels:

| **Severity** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| Error        | Serious issue that will break the application in all cases. By default will fail the build (this is configurable via _ignoreFailure_ configuration property). |
| Warn         | Issue that may impact the application in some cases, incoherence, or bad practice. Can be ignored via --quiet trigger.|
| Info         | Minor issue or recommendation. Can be ignored via --quiet trigger. |
